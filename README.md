# Rock Paper Scissors - JavaScript V2
The rule is to defeat the computer after choosing on of the three images (a rock, a paper and some scissors). Rock beats scissors, scissors cut paper, paper beats rock.

This version is easier to read than the other one. I was focused on working with functions and dynamically updating the DOM in a single place using consistent selectors and reusable function. I've tried to use more event listeners, to effectively handle user interactions through buttons and keyboard inputs, improving accesibility and interactivity. The code is cleaner and easier to follow, and also is less redundant.

In conclusion I think of this version being cleaner than the other one, making the code easier to debug and update.

## Features

1 - The computer's move si generated by a randomChoice function;
2 - Interactivity while clicking buttons using keyboard shortcuts
3 - Use of localStorage to save the progress
4 - Real-time updates
5 - Autoplay function
6 - Reset function
7 - Immediat feedback by displaying the result of each round
8 - Adaptability to different screen sizes

## Lessons Learned
1 - Modular Code Design
2 - DOM Manipulation
3 - Use of localStorage
4 - Event Listeners
5 - Math.random() function;
6 - setInterval() and clearInterval() functions;
7 - Objects

## Optimizations.

- code reusability
- dynamic UI Updates -> I've used JavaScript to dynamically update HTML elements based on user actions without reloading the page
- used of localStorage
- added interactivity for the buttons using event listeners: users can play the game using the mouse, or using keyboard shortcuts (r, p, s)
- used setInterval and clearInterval
- reduced redundand DOM manipulations
